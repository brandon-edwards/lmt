# Result directory
On training, a result directory is made under result/ directory.
We refer to this directory as result directory.
The directory names are decided depending on the name of configuration files.
Network parameters are saved under the directory
after the training if the snapshot extension under src/extension/ is specified
in a configuration file.
On evaluations with attacking methods,
their results are also save in the result directory.
